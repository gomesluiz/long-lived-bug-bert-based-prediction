\section{Threats to Validity}\label{chapter:4:sec:validity}

The main threats to validity in this study are summarized below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We have assumed that bug fix times extracted from repositories are correct. However, the real efforts times spent by developers involved in bug-fixing are not publicly available. 
    \item  We have considered six repositories, which lead to a collection composed of more than 50,000 bug reports. Although they are not representative of the population of all open source and commercial projects, the characteristics presented by them are similar to those shown in other studied repositories~\cite{Giger:2010, Lamkanfi:2010b, Saha:2015b}. 
    
    \item Another limitation is the lack of investigation regarding the impact of different quantities and truncation methods over description bug report attributes.
\end{itemize}
